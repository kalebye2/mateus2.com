A girl who jumps and collects a little bit of oregano to spice her life.
She also likes to do it rapidly.

The purpose of the game is to complete the challenge of completing all oregano ASAP - without dying, if possible.

It was made in a week.
All the elements of the game except the font were made in this timespan by me - sprites, sfx, background, music, code etc.

This game was made for [Godot Wild Jam 31](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-31).
