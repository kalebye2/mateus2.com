The idea of dealing with a challenge and overcome it is something that humanking always had with it.
And games are a way to bring this reality to a less hostile environment than the challenges for humanity like hunger, war or other miseries.

Games are a great source of challenge, interaction -- be it between humans or between human and machine --, reflection and an art that groups all the other arts to create a new and interactive experience.
