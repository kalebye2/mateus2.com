## Why a website to put a portfolio and a blog?

It is said that a good impression is important.
I, particularly, like to show people something different, that escapes from what they already know or what would be part of their daily routine.
And as a good artist/scientist/normal-person-who-hasnt-any-abnormal-characteristic I think that a website is different than a blog, a Substack, an online portfolio on a platform of which I have not much control over or only direct to my channels like Youtube, Vimeo and Itch.io, for example.

However, dealing with different content creators in tech and communication area, I realized that some of them prefer to have website - minimalist in design with lots of content or people from a niche like [Game From Scratch](https://gamefromscratch.com/) or [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/), I thought that maybe it was better to make a website and try to put all my abilities full power.
At last, I technically am also a webdesigner, content manager and programmer.

And I am very happy that you entered my website and saw this post in my blog. I also would like to say that you are welcome to access any of the content here, be it [animations](/animations), [games](/games) or know a bit more [about me](/about).

## Which tool was used to make the website?

I used a static site generator called [**Hugo**](https://gohugo.io).

Of course, with a bit of knowledge in HTML and CSS it is possible to make a cool website, but the decision to use a static site generator came from the fact of allowing a great modularity[^1] in the creation of the content.

[^1]: Made in modules. It means the system is divided in parts that fit themselves. Basically, I can mount my site, develop new functionalities and put it in the content.

And there is the advantage of being built as a static website, which means that the page is loaded automatically with your request without the need of a server trying to discover which page you want to load or use a database for it.

## Final words

If you want to be in touch, [you can do it](mailto:kalebye2@proton.me), be it to hire for a service, give a suggestion or to offend me for disagreeing with my views.
I will only ask you gently to offend me cordially.
I don't want to answer the offenses correcting them grammarly.

Ah, and I also want to update the site from time to time.
If you see, for example, in the developer tools of your browser you might see that the CSS file for the site has more themes to be chosen (but I have little time to develop this idea now).

See ya!
