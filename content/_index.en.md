## Welcome!

{{< image src="/img/porta.jpg" style="float:left;max-height:50vh;max-width:50vw;margin:2em;border-radius:1rem;" >}}

An artist?
A scientist?
A philosopher?
A joker?
A musician?
A poet?
A writer?
A programmer?
Yakissoba?

It is easy to define myself.
I am Mateus, a curly haired guy who uses glasses and likes art, science and talking in general.
Or better: I'm a psychologist-animator-musician-poet-writer-programmer-designer-generalartist-generalscientist.
I like to do what I can do.
Ah, and this site is to give a taste of what I like to do and show what I am capable of.

You might ask: "why doesn't this guy just put one or another thing that he does?"
Because this is not a curriculum, it is a personal site.
If I finish a hard puzzle and be happy about it I can post on the blog.
If I want to post a "lorem ipsum" every week I post it.
Of course, maintaining the professionalism of who is sending this site to who can hire me, present me to hire or - who knows - at least be a little more happy visiting this place.

Be free to se what I can show and, if you will, you can also [contact me](/en/contact) to talk.
Enjoy the idea!
