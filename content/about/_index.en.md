I'm **Mateus**, a *christian scientoartist/artiscientist* who writes a little.

I'm a shareholder of [**River Filmes**](https://riverfilmes.com) and my function is technical director and I make projects in animation and games in general.

I'm a psychologist by Universidade Estadual de Maringá.

I make [animations](/en/animations) since I was 14 and I like a lot frame-by-frame animations.

I also like to create [games](/en/games), mainly videogames.

I can play bass and guitar, and I have a band called Rocked with my brothers [Pedro](https://instagram.com/omelhorpedro) and [João](https://instagram.com/omelhorjao2.0).
