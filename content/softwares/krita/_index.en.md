Krita is a free and open source professional digital painting software made by artists who want art creation tools accessible to everyone.

It is a tool with support to creation of concept art, textures, paintings, illustrations, game art, comics and also vector art.

The painting tools are what draw my attention to this software.
Since simple brushes of pen and pencil to a powerful engine of watercolor brushes, it is an extremely useful tool to anyone who wants a good visual art.
