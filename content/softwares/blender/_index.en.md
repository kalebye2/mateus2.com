Blender is a CG art software free and open source.

It has support for all 3D *pipeline* - modeling, *rigging*, animation, simulation, render, composition, *motion tracking*, VFX and video editing.

To create 3D art, Blender is what I use.
I'm a fan of open source projects.
Also, the fact it is free is what attracted me to it back in 2011.
