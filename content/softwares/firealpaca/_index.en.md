FireAlpaca is a free drawing program made available from the same company responsible for Medibang Pro.

It was used as a simple alternative to more expensive softwares - and it was one of the first that I found before 2015 which made animations beyond Krita.

FireAlpaca is interesting for small animations and some static drawings.
