Based on software Toonz, this software was customized to the needs of **Studio Ghibli** and, after some years, it became a free and open source software.

Initially I used OpenToonz to compositing, but with time and practice I considered it my main tool of frame-by-frame and personal animation in general.

It is a great software to use in production - like Studio Ghibli used in years and other studios too.
