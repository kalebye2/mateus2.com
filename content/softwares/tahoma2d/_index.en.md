Tahoma2D is an animation software developed base on OpenToonz to make its functionality be more fitting to a digital animators' workflow, and also has great stop-motion features.

For being familiarized with OpenToonz, working with this software was easy for me since the beginning.
The only things I had to adjust were the project and layout management for my preferences.
It is also great for animators used to other animation tools.
