The most used software used for motion design production and with which I learned more to work at Signature Films.

[*Bruno Luna*](https://instagram.com/animabob) was my mentor for AE, teaching me how to optimize workflow with the software.

I also learned to use expressions for the animations and, as I am also a programmer, I found fascinating this possibility and try to use in each project I make in this software.
