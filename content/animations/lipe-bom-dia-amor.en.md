Lyric video for the song "Bom dia, amor!" (Good morning, darling!) from Lipe.

The direction was made by [Jow Neto](https://instagram.com/jowneto) and the idea of making the animation a simulation of a Whatsapp conversation came from him.

Firstly it was proposed that it would be a screen recording of the conversation, however this would probably be more time consuming and stressful than just animating it, so we decided to animate it (almost) fully.

In this animation I explored keyframes and expressions from After Effects and oh, boy, the rendering time was just astronomical!
