[Bruno Luna](https://www.behance.net/animabob), Brazilian animator who works for foreign companies, gave me the responsibility to make layouts for this next animation for Genome BC about genome study, this time talking about 5 myths about genomics.

Hand was itching to animate, but making the layouts and get the characters ready for him to rig was a pleasant activity.
By the way, his movement identity became very evident and it draws atention for the nice touch of the movements.
