Animation made for the marriage of Rayane.

This animation was presented before the dance of the fiances in the party.

The challenge in this animation was to make all the process - since briefing to final render - in two weeks. By the way, even if I wanted, I hardly would get someone to help on the project in this timespan, so I made since the script to the final composition.
