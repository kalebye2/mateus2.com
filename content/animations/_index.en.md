When I was 14 I discovered an animation software called [*Pivot Stickfigure Animator*](https://www.pivotanimator.net).
I played with it a bit and, when I realized, I was spending hours and hours making seconds of simple animations.
There's where I found a passion for animation.

I have animation projects published since 2011.
Some are personal projects, others paid professional work.

And well, life is animated, so animating is just expanding life in a visual and captivating style.
