My entry to [Souno's Curse Kickstarter Campaign Contest](https://pollunit.com/polls/sounoscurse-kickstarterfanart).

[Souno's Curse](https://sounoscurse.com/) is a hand drawn atmospheric metroidvania.
With my interest in the game and admiration for the art direction I decided to make this animation which references the main character in a resting point in the first cave of the game.

Krita was used to make the background and OpenToonz to animation and final composition.
