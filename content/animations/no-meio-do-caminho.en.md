Animation made for a school project about Carlos Drummond de Andrade.

The animation was drawn in [Macromedia Flash 8](/en/softwares/macromedia-flash) with the mouse.
The project was thought to be ready in one week - one week before the deadline for the presentation because I still had to study the writer to the project.

The teacher changed the writer for our group's presentation in the last week.
But I still decided to publish the animation in Youtube.
I was going to make a surprise, so I never said I made an animation.

Probably she doesn't know till today that I had made an animation for that project (unless she is seeing this page...).
