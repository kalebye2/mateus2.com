An animation made for [Genome BC](https://www.genomebc.ca/) in partnership with [Bruno Luna](https://www.instagram.com/animabob/).

This is a *freelance* job.

The facts mainly animated by me are: 02, 07, 11, 17, 18 e 20.

This was the first animation where I used After Effects to animate fully a scene - which is Fact 02.
The 3D background in Fact 17 was made in Blender.
