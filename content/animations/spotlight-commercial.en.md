Animation made for the [Animation Career Review](https://www.animationcareerreview.com/) contest themed **Make a Commercial**.

In this animation I got frame-by-frame animation to the limit, drawing each part of the movement - differently than [A Jurassic Park Parody](/en/animations/a-jurassic-park-parody).

The product of the animation isn't real.
